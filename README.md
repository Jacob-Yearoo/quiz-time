# Jacob Yearoo - Quiz Time

Project two - interactive front-end site

I have made a very simple online quiz, it aims to present the user with a question and 4 answers which then give feedback dependent on whether the answer was correct or not.

The Value that I will get out of this website is:

- Valuable experience learning Javascript
- Provide entertainment for visitors to the site 
- Includes links to my social media and Github profiles, so could potentially increase my prospects

The Value that visitors will get from this site are:

- Some new knowledge on general questions that they may not have known before
- Some entertainment to pass the time

## User Experience

### The Strategy
The idea was to provide a small fun distraction for users.
### The Scope
I wanted to make the game uncomplicated, it's very simple, provides feedback on right and wrong answers to keep visitors engaged. 
### The Structure
Everything is on one page, the questions are displayed in the same box, and new answers occupy the grid beneath the answer, below that are the buttons to start the game, end the game and to proceed to the next question. the page was designed to be condensed so it's not cumbersome to use and can be easliy accessible to mobile users.

### The Surface

I opted to keep all of the content simple Grey/White to provide a contrast and make it easy to read
## Features

- text content changes depending on what buttons you press
- "start" and "next" to progress the quiz
- "end" button to break out of the game 
- social media links at the bottom of the page

## Features I'd Like to Implement

- I'd like to include a score counter that increments score dependant on your answer
- would like to add some graphics, more than what's just in the heading.

## Tech

**HTML:** Used to input all of the content on index.html

**CSS:** Used to style all of the content, and to adjust responsiveness on different screen sizes.

**Javascript:** Used to write out the functions that allow the game to work.

**Google Fonts:** Supplied the fonts for the header and body.

**Font Awesome:** Used for the social media icons in the footer.

## Testing

The website does achieve the intended goal of providing some light entertainment and teaching users about some new knowledge that they may not have had before.
If the user finds they want to know more about me all the social media links work as intended and open in a new tab for ease of access.

It's has passed all validators.

The site was tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari to ensure the desired outcome no matter where it is being viewed from, I also adjusted the site to remain readable on different screen sizes (going from my 5120px wide screen, to regular full HD screens, to tablets and finally to phones with the Iphone 5 being the lowest size I made adjustments for)
